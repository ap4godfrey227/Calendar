# Calendar

This is a calendar that prompts for the number of days in the month and the starting day of the week and then creates a visual representation of the month. It also has a "notes" system where off to the side it will display any notes you wish to make (i.e. Dentist appointments, assignment due dates, etc.). This was also among my first ever projects in coding and it was submitted to College Board for the AP Computer Science Principles exam, on which I earned a 5.

This program was made in Python 2.7
